# icubaby

A C++ Baby Library to Immediately Convert Unicode. The icubaby library offers a
portable, header-only, dependency-free, library for C++ 17 or later. Fast,
minimal, and easy to use for converting sequences of text between any of the
Unicode UTF encodings. It does not allocate dynamic memory and neither throws or
catches exceptions.

> icubaby is in no way related to the
> [International Components for Unicode](https://icu.unicode.org) library!

## Introduction

C++ 17 [deprecated](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0618r0.html)
the standard library's `<codecvt>` header file which contained its unicode
conversion facets. Those features weren‚Äôt easy to use correctly but without
them code is forced to look to other libraries. icubaby is such a library that
fulfills the role of converting between the expressions of Unicode. It is simple
to use and exceptionally simple to integrate into a project.

The library offers an API which converts to and from UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32
encodings. It can also consume a byte stream of where an optional
[byte order mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) at the start of
the stream identifies both the source encoding and byte-order.

## Installation

icubaby is entirely contained within a single header file. Installation can be
as simple as copying that file ([include/icubaby/icubaby.hpp](include/icubaby/icubaby.hpp))
into your project. It has no dependencies and self-configures to your environment.

## Usage

Check out the project documentation: https://paulhuggett-icubaby.readthedocs.io/en

icubaby uses four different types to express the different Unicode encodings that it supports:

Type | Meaning |
---- | ------- |
`std::byte` | Encoding and byte-order is determined by the stream byte order mark
`icubaby::char8` | UTF-8. `icubaby::char8` is defined as `char8_t` when the native type is available and `char` otherwise
`char16_t` | UTF-16 host-native endian
`char32_t` | UTF-32 host-native endian

There are three ways to use the icubaby library depending on your needs:

1. [C++ 20 range adaptor](#c-20-range-adaptor)
1. [Iterator interface](#the-iterator-interface)
1. [Converting one code-unit at a time](#converting-one-code-unit-at-a-time)

### C++ 20 Range Adaptor

C++ 20 introduced the ranges library for composable and less
error-prone interaction with iterators and containers. In icubaby, we can
transform a range of input values from one Unicode encoding to another using
a single range adaptor:

```cpp
auto const in = std::array{char32_t{0x1F600}};
auto r = in | icubaby::views::transcode<char32_t, char16_t>;
std::vector<char16_t> out;
std::ranges::copy(r, std::back_inserter(out));
```

This code converts a single Unicode code-point üòÄ (U+1F600 GRINNING FACE) from
UTF-32 to UTF-16 and will copy two UTF-16 code-units (0xD83D and 0xDE00) into
the `out` vector.

```cpp
auto const in = std::array{std::byte{0xFE}, std::byte{0xFF}, std::byte{0x00},
                           std::byte{'A'},  std::byte{0x00}, std::byte{'b'}};
auto r = in | icubaby::views::transcode<std::byte, icubaby::char8>;
std::vector<icubaby::char8> out;
std::ranges::copy(r, std::back_inserter(out));
```

This snippet converts ‚ÄúAb‚Äù (U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A), (U+0042 LATIN SMALL LETTER B) from big-endian UTF-16 to UTF-8.

See the [C++20 Range Adaptor documentation](https://paulhuggett-icubaby.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ranges.html)
for more details.

### The Iterator Interface

```cpp
auto const in = std::vector{char8_t{0xF0}, char8_t{0x9F}, char8_t{0x98}, char8_t{0x80}};
std::vector<char16_t> out;
icubaby::t8_16 t;
auto it = icubaby::iterator{&t, std::back_inserter (out)};
for (auto cu: in) {
  *(it++) = cu;
}
it = t.end_cp (it);
```

The `icubaby::iterator<>` class offers a familiar output iterator for using a
transcoder. Each code unit from the input encoding is written to the iterator
and this writes the output encoding to a second iterator. This enables use to
use standard algorithms such as [`std::copy`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/copy)
with the library.

### Converting One Code-Unit at a Time

Let‚Äôs try converting a single Unicode emoji character üòÄ (U+1F600 GRINNING
FACE) expressed as four UTF-8 code units (0xF0, 0x9F, 0x98, 0x80) to UTF-16
(where it is the surrogate pair 0xD83D, 0xDE00).

```cpp
std::vector<char16_t> out;
auto it = std::back_inserter (out);
icubaby::t8_16 t;
for (auto cu: {0xF0, 0x9F, 0x98, 0x80}) {
  it = t (cu, it);
}
it = t.end_cp (it);
```

The `out` vector will contain a two UTF-16 code units 0xD83D and 0xDE00. See
the [explicit conversion documentation](https://paulhuggett-icubaby.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explicit-conversion.html)
for more details.
