Welcome to icubaby's documentation!
===================================

icubaby is a C++ Library to Immediately Convert Unicode. It is a portable, header-only, dependency-free library for C++ 17 or later. Fast, minimal, and easy to use for converting sequences of text between any of the Unicode UTF encodings. It does not allocate dynamic memory and neither throws or catches exceptions.
