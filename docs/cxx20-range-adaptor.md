# C++ 20 Range Adaptor

C++ 20 introduces the ranges library for more composable and less error-prone interaction with iterators and containers. In icubaby, we can transform a range of input values from one Unicode encoding to another using a single range adaptor:

## Example

~~~cpp
#include "icubaby/icubaby.hpp"
#include <vector>
int main() {
  auto const in = std::vector{char32_t{0x1F600}};
  auto const r = in | icubaby::ranges::transcode<char32_t, char16_t>;
  std::vector<char16_t> out;
  std::ranges::copy(r, std::back_inserter(out));
}
~~~

This code wants to convert a single Unicode code-point ðŸ˜€ (U+1F600 GRINNING FACE) from UTF-32 to UTF-16.
As in the previous examples, the `out` vector will contain a two UTF-16 code units 0xD83D and 0xDE00.

You can experiment with a working example using [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/z94x9dvh3).

### Disecting this code

1. Define the input range:

    ~~~cpp
    auto const in = std::vector{char32_t{0x1F600}};
    ~~~

    We express the input as a container with our input text consisting simply of U+1F600 GRINNING FACE expressed in UTF-32.

2. Create a range with a view of our container and pass it to the icubaby `transcode` range adaptor:

    ~~~cpp
    auto const r = in | icubaby::ranges::transcode<char32_t, char16_t>;
    ~~~

    The first template argument for `icubaby::ranges::transcode<>` is the encoding of the input text (one of `icubaby::char8`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`), the second argument is the desired encoding of the output text.

    We now have the range `r` containing the UTF-16 code-units that correspond to the original input text.

3. The final step is to record the values within the range `r`. In C++ 20, this can be achieved with the [std::ranges::copy()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/ranges/copy) algorithm:

    ~~~cpp
    std::vector<char16_t> out;
    std::ranges::copy(r, std::back_inserter(out));
    ~~~

    If you are using the C++ 23 ranges library, you can simplify this even further using [std::ranges::to()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges/to):

    ~~~cpp
    auto const out = r | std::ranges::to<std::vector> ();
    ~~~
